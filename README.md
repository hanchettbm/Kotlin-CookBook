# Overview

My project is a Kotlin based user interactive cookbook from the command 
line. The user can add a recipe to the cookbook that includes the 
ingredients, how much, baking time, and instructions and so on. It also
allows the user to delete recipes, or clear the cookbook as well as view
it in a nice format. 

Purpose:  
My purpose for writing this software was to find a simple yet useful
way to learn the Kotlin program language and its syntax. I also wanted to 
learn how the user could interact with the program and do it in a way that 
was practical and useful. A cookbook was a good answer for storing data.
